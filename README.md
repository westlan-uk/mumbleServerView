mumbleServerView
================

A very small PHP/JSON app that shows a list of users connected to a Mumble server, based on MumPI.

The MumPI project intends to be a fully featured admin tool, with viewers included. It is maintained
on GitHub: https://github.com/Kissaki/MumPI . This project is based on MumPI and will follow its updates,
but the code is intended to be much smaller, a read only viewer and an API for people to easily build
their own viewers out of JavaScript, CSS and HTML5.

Installation
===
Simply create a settings.php file, using settings.default.php as a template.
